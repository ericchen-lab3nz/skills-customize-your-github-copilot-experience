Build a classic Hangman word-guessing game in Python. Practice string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and user input while creating a fun, interactive program.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: Set Up the Game

#### Description
Initialize your game by preparing the word list, selecting a secret word, and setting up variables to track guesses and attempts.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Display the current progress (e.g., _ _ t h o n)

- Track and display incorrect guesses remaining
- End the game with a win message if the word is guessed
